# PREDICTING-CREDIT-CARD-APPROVAL
Building a ML algorithm to predict whether or not a credit card application will be approved.

This is a part of DataCamp's structured projects. The core aim of this project is to build an algorithm that predicts the approval or denial of a credit card application based on certain characteristics of the applicant. The classifier used here is logistic regression and the model obtained after tuning had an accuracy of 85.3% which is a significant improvement on the baseline of 55% that was defined.

My motivation for completing this project is enhance my knowledge of the Machine Learning workflow. Some of the extra skills I gained is using the LabelEncoder class of the SciKit-Learn library for easy handling of categorical variables, performing a grid search to tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance, among many others.

Have fun reading!
